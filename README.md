MVC_micro
=========

Small MVC framework to work in as3 projects. Good for small projects.
There is an example folder to see a basic project set up with the MVC classes.
The basic idea is to use the existing MVC core classes and create new clases acording to the MVC patterns. The new ones should extend the core classes included in this project.
